# SQL Tables Operations Guide  
**Key Concepts & Commands**  

---

## 1. Table Creation  
**Syntax**:  
```sql  
CREATE TABLE table_name (  
    column1 DATATYPE CONSTRAINT,  
    column2 DATATYPE,  
    PRIMARY KEY (column1),  
    FOREIGN KEY (column2) REFERENCES other_table(column)  
);  
```  

**Example**:  
```sql  
CREATE TABLE courses (  
    id INTEGER NOT NULL,  
    name VARCHAR,  
    PRIMARY KEY (id)  
);  
```  

---

## 2. Temporary Tables  
- Exist only during the current session:  
```sql  
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table (...);  
```  

---

## 3. Constraints  
- Add constraints later (SQLite workaround required):  
```sql  
ALTER TABLE students  
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_course_id  
FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(id);  
```  

---

## 4. Row Operations  
### Insert  
```sql  
INSERT INTO courses VALUES (1, 'Data Engineering');  
```  

### Delete  
```sql  
DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 1;  
```  

### Update  
```sql  
UPDATE students SET lastname = 'Durand' WHERE id = 2;  
```  

---

## 5. Foreign Key Constraints  
- Prevent orphaned records (e.g., deleting a course with enrolled students fails).  

---

## 6. Table Deletion  
- Order matters (delete dependent tables first):  
```sql  
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS students;  
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS courses;  
```  

---

## 7. Views  
- Virtual tables for simplified querying:  
```sql  
CREATE VIEW v_tracks AS  
SELECT tracks.name, albums.Title AS album  
FROM tracks  
JOIN albums ON tracks.AlbumId = albums.AlbumId;  
```  

---

## 8. Key Commands  
- Verify tables:  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM table;  
```  

- Enable foreign keys (SQLite):  
```sql  
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;  
```  
``` 

**To use**:  
1. Save as `.md` file.  
2. Preview in any Markdown viewer (e.g., VS Code, GitHub, Obsidian).  
3. Export to PDF using tools like [Markdown to PDF converters](https://md2pdf.netlify.app/).
